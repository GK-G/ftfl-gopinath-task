FTFL Technology - Cards and Wallet Screen
This Flutter project is an interview task for FTFL Technology. The goal is to design a Cards and Wallet Screen using reusable common widgets for an efficient and consistent UI.

Overview
This project demonstrates:

Reusability: Common widgets like FeatureCard and LimitCard are designed for consistent use across the application.
Modular Design: The Cards and Wallet screen is built with scalable and clean code practices.
Responsive UI: The widgets are flexible and adapt well to different screen sizes.
Widgets

Properties:
title (String): Title text for the feature.
icon (IconData): Icon representing the feature.
Example:
